# FieldCalculator-repo contains Python scripts that can be used in the Field Calculator within ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro to perform a variety of tasks.

Over the course of the past several years I have created a small assortment of scripts for the Field Calculator (FC) in ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro.
A context for each script will be provided along with descriptions of any functions.

Thanks for checking these out! - MHagarGIS
